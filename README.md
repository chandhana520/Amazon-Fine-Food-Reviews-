# Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews-
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Text Featurization(BOW, tfidf, Word2Vec). Build several ML models like KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM
# Objective
Given a text review, determine the sentiment of the review whether its positive or negative.

# About Dataset
The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon.

* Number of reviews: 568,454
* Number of users: 256,059
* Number of products: 74,258
* Timespan: Oct 1999 - Oct 2012
* Number of Attributes/Columns in data: 10
# Attribute Information:

* Id
* ProductId - unique identifier for the product
* UserId - unqiue identifier for the user
* ProfileName
* HelpfulnessNumerator - number of users who found the review helpful
* HelpfulnessDenominator - number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not
* Score - rating between 1 and 5
* Time - timestamp for the review
* Summary - brief summary of the review
* Text - text of the review
# Outcomes
* Learnt how to do Sentiment analysis.
* Learnt how to apply concepts Like Bag of Words, Tfidf and Wor2Vec.
* Learnt how to do Text Preprocessing.
* Learnt various Supervised Learning Techniques like (Logstics Regression, SVM's, Decision Trees, GBDT's, RF's, AdaBoost etc)
* Learnt how to perform Dimensionality Reduction.
* Learnt how to handle large dimensional Data.
* Learnt about the curse of dimensionality problem.
* Performed Clustering by removing the labels from the dataset.
* Generated Cooccurance Matrix and Applied Matrix Factorization.
* Finally Learnt what works best in what situation. (Like Logistics Regression works well when dimensionality is high).
# Conclusions :
An Enlightening Introduction to Machine Learning providing skills to work on future projects
